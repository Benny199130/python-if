Here we will check if my name is "Gianluca" or if my name is not "Gianluca"


def my_name(very_name):
  if very_name == "Gianluca":
  return "This is my very name"
  if very_name == "Betta":
  return "it isn't my very name"
  
  #enter very_name
  
  very_name = "Gianluca"
  print(my_name(very_name))
  
  #That's all right now
